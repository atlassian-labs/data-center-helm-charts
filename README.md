This project contains [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/) for installing Atlassian's [Jira Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center/jira), [Confluence Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center/confluence), and [Bitbucket Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center/bitbucket) on Kubernetes. 

Use the charts to install and operate Data Center products within a Kubernetes cluster of your choice. It can be a managed environment, such as [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/kubernetes-service/), [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), or a custom on-premise system.

## Support disclaimer

These Helm charts are in **Beta phase and unsupported**, with the goal of introducing official support once they have been
stabilized.

Also, we **donâ€™t officially support** the functionality described in the [examples](docs/examples) or the documented [platforms](docs/PLATFORMS.md). You should use them for reference only. 

## Architecture

The Atlassian Data Center Helm charts will provision and deploy the necessary Kubernetes resources required for running an Atlassian Data Center product within a Kubernetes cluster. The Helm charts rely a number of cloud based [prerequisites](./docs/PREREQUISITES.md) to be in place before installation. 

The diagram below provides a high-level overview of what a typical deployment might look like when using these Helm charts. A set of pre-provisioned resources have been stood up using a favoured cloud provider providing physical backing to those logical resources provisioned into the Kuberentes cluster itself.
