[![Atlassian license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](CONTRIBUTING.md)

This project contains [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/) for Atlassian's [Data Center products](https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center).
These charts are experimental and unsupported, with the aim of introducing official support once they have been stabilized.

The charts will allow the Data Center products to be easily installed and operated within a Kubernetes cluster,
whether it be a managed environment such as Amazon EKS, or a custom, on-premise system.
